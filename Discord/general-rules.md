# ⚔️ Thaurosia – Server & Discord Rules

These rules exist to preserve fairness, immersion, and respect across all parts of Thaurosia — both in-game and on Discord.
Ignorance and not being up to date of the rules is not an excuse. Play fair, stay respectful, and build the world together.

## 🕊️ 1. Respect & Conduct

Treat everyone with respect — harassment, discrimination, or toxicity will not be tolerated.

Arguments, name-calling, or drama will result in moderation action.

Keep interactions civil at all times — no excuses.

What happens in-character stays in-character; using RP to attack players is not allowed.

## 💬 2. Chat & Voice Etiquette

Keep chat appropriate for all players.

NSFW, sexually explicit, excessively violent, or offensive content is strictly prohibited.

No spamming, trolling, or flooding text/voice channels.

Use the correct channels for discussions; off-topic chat belongs in designated areas.

Voice chat harassment, screaming, or soundboards that disrupt others will result in removal.

## 🛡️ 3. Roleplay Conduct

All official roleplay must take place within the Thaurosia server environment.

RP done outside the server (in DMs, group chats, etc.) is discouraged and not considered canon.

Stay in character while in RP zones and follow the established lore.

Combat outside of RP (such as PvP in the wild) is allowed and encouraged, but is not lore-official unless both parties agree and staff approve.

Godmodding, metagaming, and powerplaying are strictly prohibited.

Do not retcon (rewrite or undo RP events) without mutual consent and staff approval.

Combat, conflict, and outcomes within RP must be fair, logical, and agreed upon by all participants.

Avoid breaking immersion — use OOC (out-of-character) brackets or channels when necessary.

## ⚖️ 4. Staff & Enforcement

Staff decisions are final.

Arguing with or impersonating staff is not allowed.

If you believe a decision was unfair, open a ticket and provide evidence — do not argue in public.

Lying in tickets or manipulating evidence will result in disciplinary action.

Respect staff boundaries at all times.

## ⚙️ 5. Gameplay Integrity

Exploiting, cheating, or using unfair modifications is strictly forbidden.

Duping, x-ray texture packs, hacked clients, or macros/scripts are considered cheating.

Intentional griefing, theft, or destruction outside of approved RP scenarios is not allowed.

AFK farming or automation that disrupts server balance will be removed.

## 🏰 6. Community Integrity

Do not advertise or promote other servers, Discords, or communities.

No malicious links, self-promotion, or external invites without permission.

Treat new players and guests with respect — help maintain a welcoming environment.

Evading punishment (alt accounts, VPNs, etc.) will result in a permanent ban.

## 🕯️ 7. Final Rule

Common sense applies.

Staff may take action on behavior not listed here if it harms the community or violates the spirit of the rules.
